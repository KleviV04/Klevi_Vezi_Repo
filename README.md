# Drone Delivery with Battery Limits

**CEN 352 – Artificial Intelligence** 
This project simulates a **drone delivery system** that must deliver multiple packages on a grid while managing:
- Limited battery power  
- Wind zones that affect energy use  
- Recharge stations with different recharge speeds  

Two search algorithms were implemented and compared:
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** – uninformed, explores all options
- **A\*** – informed search with an admissible heuristic for faster results

The project includes:
- `drone_solver.py` → main code with UCS and A\* implementations  
- `report_drone_delivery.md` → markdown version of the report  
- `Report_assignment.pdf` → final report (PDF)
